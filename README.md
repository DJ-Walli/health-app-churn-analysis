📜 My Project Journey
Topic Selection – Chose "Root Cause Analysis of Churn in a Health Subscription App" for my portfolio.

Data Preparation

Added age_group column:

Young = ≤ 25 years

Mid = 26–40 years

SC = 41+ years

Added total_days_spent column for churned users.

Fixed spelling and category inconsistencies.

EDA (Power BI & Excel) – Explored churn across:

Subscription type

Price plans

Gender and age groups

Onboarding completion

Coach interactions

Workout & diet logs

Early engagement (first 7 days)

Report Creation – Wrote a detailed report, reformatted into corporate language, and added relevant visuals.

Recommendations – Suggested targeted, actionable solutions to reduce churn and improve user retention.

📊 Key Insights
Trial users churn the most (31%), followed by free (20%) and paid (16%) users.

Paid users on the ₹499 plan had the lowest churn rate, indicating plan structure issues.

Low early engagement (e.g., fewer minutes in first week) predicts churn.

Onboarding completion is critical – non-onboarded users churn more.

Coach interaction impacts retention – churned users average 2–3 interactions vs. 3–4 for retained users.

Workout/diet log activity was similar for both churned and retained users.

No significant churn difference across age groups and gender.
