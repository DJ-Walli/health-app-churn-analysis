📜 My Project Journey
Topic Selection – Chose "Root Cause Analysis of Churn in a Health Subscription App" for my portfolio.

Data Preparation:-
  1.Added age_group column:
    Young = ≤ 25 years
    Mid = 26–40 years
    SC = 41+ years

  2.Added total_days_spent column for churned users.

  3.Fixed spelling and category inconsistencies.

EDA (Power BI & Excel) – Explored churn across:
  Subscription type
  Price plans
  Gender and age groups
  Onboarding completion
  Coach interactions
  Workout & diet logs
  Early engagement (first 7 days)

Report Creation – Wrote a detailed report, reformatted into corporate language, and added relevant visuals.

Recommendations – Suggested targeted, actionable solutions to reduce churn and improve user retention.

📊 Key Insights
  1.Trial users churn the most (31%), followed by free (20%) and paid (16%) users.
  2.Paid users on the ₹499 plan had the lowest churn rate, indicating plan structure issues.
  3.Low early engagement (e.g., fewer minutes in first week) predicts churn.
  4.Onboarding completion is critical – non-onboarded users churn more.
  5.Coach interaction impacts retention – churned users average 2–3 interactions vs. 3–4 for retained users.
  6.Workout/diet log activity was similar for both churned and retained users.
  7.No significant churn difference across age groups and gender.
